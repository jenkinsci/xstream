    <h2>List and Forum</h2>

    <p>The mailing lists have been consolidated into one Google Group for
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user">users and developers</a> asking questions about XStream's
    usage, making enhancements requests or proposing improvements for its implementation.  Another read-only Google
    Group is for <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-notifications">all kind of notifications</a> like
    announcements, commit or build server status messages.</p>
    
    <p>Google Groups provide standard mailing list functionality as well as a user interface in form of a web-based forum.</p>

    <h2>News</h2>

	<p><a href="http://www.gmane.org/">Gmane</a> offers a news server interface for ordinary mailing lists.  The
	service collects all mails from the mailing list and offers them in a news group.  The same news group was already
	used for the old user's mailing list of Codehaus.</p>

	<p>The former mailing lists hosted at Codehaus are gone, but still available in public archives
	at <a href="http://markmail.org/search/list:org.codehaus.xstream">MarkMail</a>.</p>
